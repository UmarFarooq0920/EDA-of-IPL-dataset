# EDA-of-IPL-dataset
Performed EDA on Indian Premier League dataset.
This dataset actually consists of two datasets. one has information about every match and other has information of every ball/delivery. 
First of all we import the necessary libraries than I handled the missing values. There were some spelling mistakes in the 'matches' dataset like rising pune super giants and rising pune super giant , single team is represented as two different teams here because of spelling. Similar kind of problem was with M chinnaswamy stadium's name.
Than I performed EDA of the data.
